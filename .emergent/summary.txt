The previous AI engineer successfully transformed a basic trading bot script into a comprehensive full-stack application. Initially, the focus was on setting up the environment, installing dependencies, and bringing up the React frontend and FastAPI backend. Key challenges included resolving Python library compatibility (TA-Lib vs. pandas-ta), fixing frontend CSS and environment variable issues, and troubleshooting API data fetching problems. After establishing the core application, the engineer integrated multiple machine learning models (XGBoost, CatBoost, Prophet, TPOT) with specialized roles and an ensemble system, addressing specific user requirements for price prediction, sentiment analysis, and pattern discovery. The latest phase involved implementing advanced UI/UX (Notika-style dashboard) and preparing for real-time ML model training visualization and mock trading capabilities, which is the current ongoing task. The system now features robust data fetching, technical indicator calculations, and an intelligent decision-making pipeline.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a sophisticated trading bot application built as a full-stack system. The core problem is to create an autonomous, intelligent learner that makes trading decisions based on various data sources and machine learning models.
Key features explicitly requested and their implementation status:
- **ML Models**: Integrate XGBoost (price movement prediction based on technical indicators, sentiment, events; trade if prob > 70%), CatBoost (sentiment impact modeling from news headlines), Prophet (time series forecasting for price), and TPOT (auto pattern discovery for optimal ML pipeline). All models should combine their reports for best results.
- **Data Sources**: EODHD for live/historical market data, NewsAPI for sentiment, and manual tweet inputs () for expert bias.
- **Real-time Updates**: System should update every few seconds.
- **User Interface**: A Streamlit-like dashboard for real-time market data, technical indicators, ML predictions (including probability and decision reason), expert tweet insights, economic events, RL agent decisions, and performance metrics.
- **Trade History**: Visualize trade history (pips, wins/losses) and allow CSV export.
- **Model Persistence**: Save ML models using .
- **Autonomous Learning**: The bot should be an autonomous intelligent learner.
- **Rigorous Backtesting**: Extensively backtest on unseen historical data, accounting for transaction costs and slippage.
- **Paper Trading (Forward Testing)**: Deploy in a simulated live market environment.
- **Risk Management**: Implement position sizing rules (based on account balance and risk %), maximum drawdown limits (stop trading if reached), and correlation awareness for multiple assets.
- **Dashboard Redesign**: Adopt a Notika-style dashboard design.
- **ML Training Visualization**: Show real-time training progress, including win/loss rates and mock trades with pips won/lost.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.

**Directory Structure:**


-   : Python dependencies for the backend.
    -   *Changes*: Initially updated to use  instead of  due to system dependency issues. Additional ML libraries like , , , ,  were added.
-   : Main FastAPI application, handling API endpoints and business logic.
    -   *Importance*: Central hub for backend functionality, including data fetching, technical analysis, ML model integration, trading signals, and database interactions.
    -   *Changes*: Extensively modified to integrate real-time data fetching, technical indicator calculation, ML model endpoints, trading signal generation, sample data seeding, and error handling. It now imports  and .
-   : Environment variables for the backend.
    -   *Importance*: Stores sensitive information like MongoDB URL and API keys (, ).
    -   *Changes*: API keys for EODHD and NewsAPI were added.
-   : Encapsulates the logic for specialized ML models (XGBoost, CatBoost, TPOT, Prophet) and their ensemble coordination.
    -   *Importance*: Separates ML-specific logic from the main server, making the codebase more modular and maintainable. This file orchestrates the training, prediction, and combination of results from different models.
    -   *Changes*: Newly created file to implement the requested specialized ML models and their ensemble logic, including data preparation and model training/prediction methods.
-   : Handles mock trades and real-time training simulation for ML models.
    -   *Importance*: Provides the framework for simulating trades during training and tracking performance metrics like win/loss rates and pips.
    -   *Changes*: Newly created file to support the user's request for real-time training visualization and mock trades.
-   : Node.js dependencies and scripts for the React frontend.
    -   *Changes*: Dependencies for React and related tools were installed using yarn install v1.22.22

-   : Main React component, rendering the trading dashboard UI.
    -   *Importance*: The primary frontend file responsible for displaying all trading bot features, real-time data, and user interactions.
    -   *Changes*: Heavily rewritten from an initial Streamlit-like structure to a full React application. It includes UI for market data, indicators, ML predictions, risk management, performance metrics, and a Train Models button. The latest changes aim to transform its design to a Notika-style dashboard and integrate real-time training progress.

<pending_tasks>
- **ML Model Training Implementation:** While the models are integrated, the actual training process needs to be fully fleshed out to utilize historical data and enable the Train Models button to make them Active. The Insufficient training data error needs to be addressed.
- **Full Backtesting Engine:** The comprehensive backtesting (with transaction costs and slippage) is a high-level requirement that needs dedicated implementation.
- **Paper Trading Environment:** Deployment in a paper trading environment is a future step.
- **Position Sizing and Drawdown Limits:** While discussed, the full implementation of dynamic position sizing and hard-coded drawdown limits into the trading logic still needs verification and robust integration.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was in the process of implementing significant enhancements to the trading bot's user interface and core functionality, driven by the user's explicit requests. The primary focus was on addressing the inactive status of the ML models and enhancing the dashboard's visual appeal and training feedback.

Specifically, the work involved:
1.  **Explaining ML Model Status:** Clarifying that inactive models mean they haven't been trained yet, while active means they are ready to make predictions. The RL Agent was already active, but the specialized ML models (XGBoost, CatBoost, Prophet, TPOT) required training data to become active.
2.  **Dashboard Redesign (Notika-style):** The frontend () is being revamped to match the aesthetic and layout of the Notika admin template, as requested by the user. This involves substantial changes to the UI/UX components.
3.  **Real-time ML Training Visualization:** Implementing features to show live training progress. This includes displaying win/loss rates and performance metrics (pips won/lost) during mock trades that occur as the models train.
4.  **Training Simulator Integration:** A new Python file, , was created on the backend. This file is intended to house the logic for simulating mock trades and tracking performance metrics during the ML model training process.
5.  **Backend Integration for Training Simulator:** The main backend server () was updated to integrate the newly created , including adding new API endpoints specifically for the training simulation functionality.
6.  **Frontend Update for New Features:** The  file was updated to incorporate the UI elements and logic required to display the Notika-style dashboard and the real-time training progress/mock trades visualization.

The last action performed was restarting the backend to apply the changes related to the training simulator integration. The next logical step is to verify these changes and continue building out the training visualization and mock trading capabilities.
