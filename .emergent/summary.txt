The AI engineer successfully transitioned a general trading bot into a specialized, autonomous scalping application. Initial work focused on setting up a React-FastAPI-MongoDB stack, integrating ML models, and addressing critical backend serialization issues. Key achievements include a comprehensive UI overhaul, implementing persistent learning for the RL agent and ML models, and fixing complex frontend-backend connectivity problems within the containerized environment. The bot now features auto-training on startup, a dynamic risk management system, and an enhanced analytics dashboard. The most recent focus has shifted to deep AI/ML optimization, aiming to improve win rates and address specific performance issues for currency pairs like EUR/USD and XAUUSD, by refining reward functions, pattern recognition, and ensemble weighting.

<product_requirements>
The user initially required a sophisticated, autonomous trading bot integrating ML models (XGBoost, CatBoost, Prophet, TPOT) for price prediction, sentiment, and pattern discovery using EODHD, NewsAPI, and tweet data. The bot needed real-time updates, a dashboard visualizing market data, indicators, predictions, risk, performance, and trade history, alongside model persistence.
Key refinements included:
- **Scalping Focus**: Optimization for fast timeframes (1-minute, 30-seconds) and specific scalping strategies.
- **Enhanced Trade History**: A detailed table with 17 specific columns (e.g., Confidence, Bot Strategy, Exit Reason).
- **Dashboard Cleanup**: Removal of candlestick charts and Total Pips, displaying essential scalping metrics (Total Trades, Win Rate, Total Profit, Max Drawdown, Bot Confidence, Current Streak, Last Trade Result).
- **Persistent Learning**: Automatic saving and loading of the bot's state (RL agent memory, trained models, feature history, trade logs) for continuous learning.
- **Risk Management**: Starting balance of 00, 1.5% max risk per trade (), with position sizing and RL agent factoring this cap.
- **Enhanced Scalping Analytics**: Display Profit Factor, strategy/reason for top gainers/losers, RL metrics (reward, epsilon decay, streak), and automatic flagging of weak strategies.
- **Bot Readiness Score**: A dashboard indicator (✅ Bot Ready to Trade or ⏳ Still Learning) based on model training, positive average pips, and top strategy win rate (>50%).
- **High Confidence Notifications**: Alert for signals with confidence >65%.
- **Automated Training**: Removal of manual Start Training buttons; automatic training on dashboard load if models are untrained and sufficient data exists, or automatic loading of saved models.
- **Advanced AI Optimization (Current)**:
    - **Enhanced Reward Function**: Penalize EUR/USD false breakouts, reward consistent small wins (5-20 pips), adjust for volatility/history, include time penalties and confidence/risk factors.
    - **Pattern Recognition**: Detect false breakouts (EUR/USD), momentum continuation (JPY), Gold volatility, and News Fade opportunities.
    - **Dynamic Model Ensemble Weighting**: Adaptive weights based on currency pair (XAUUSD=Prophet, EUR/USD=RL Agent) and real-time performance.
    - **Advanced Exit Strategy**: Partial profits (60% target), pair-specific targets/SL, time-based exits (<1 hour), confidence-based management.
    - **Enhanced State Space**: Comprehensive features (Price Action: velocity, spread, tick volume; Market Structure; Session Features; News Impact; Risk Metrics).
    - **Curriculum Learning**: Progressive training stages (XAUUSD -> JPY -> EUR/USD -> Full market).
The overarching goal is to improve the bot's win rate from 44% to 65%+, maintain a 1:2 minimum risk-reward, reduce drawdowns, and achieve sub-second decision making.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with a significant AI implementation prompt focused on optimizing the scalping trading bot's mixed performance. The user highlighted excellent results on XAUUSD but consistent losses on EUR/USD, with an overall win rate of 44%.

The current work involves a comprehensive enhancement of the bot's core AI logic, specifically targeting:
1.  **Enhanced Reward Function**: Creating a sophisticated reward function for the RL agent ( class) that penalizes EUR/USD false breakouts, rewards consistent small wins (5-20 pips), adjusts based on currency pair volatility and historical performance, includes time-based penalties for quick scalps, and factors in confidence levels and risk assessment.
2.  **Pattern Recognition System**: Implementing a  class to identify false breakouts (especially for EUR/USD), momentum continuation (JPY pairs), gold volatility patterns, and news fade opportunities. This system will analyze trade setups and return feature dictionaries for RL training.
3.  **Dynamic Model Ensemble Weighting**: Developing an  that dynamically adjusts model weights based on market conditions, with specific emphasis on increasing Prophet's weight for XAUUSD, favoring the RL Agent for EUR/USD, and maintaining CatBoost/XGBoost for JPY pairs. It will also combine model predictions with these dynamic weights.
4.  **Advanced Exit Strategy**: Implementing a  with intelligent exit logic that includes taking partial profits at 60% of target, uses pair-specific profit targets and stop losses, includes time-based exits (trades shouldn't last > 1 hour), and incorporates confidence-based position management.
5.  **Enhanced State Space**: Expanding the  to create a more comprehensive state representation for RL training, including price action (velocity, spread, tick volume), market structure (support/resistance, trend strength), session features, news impact, and risk metrics.
6.  **Curriculum Learning Implementation**: Designing progressive training stages () to train the bot on best-performing setups first (XAUUSD), then JPY pairs, then EUR/USD with false breakout detection, and finally full market conditions.

The AI engineer has just acknowledged these requirements and is preparing to implement these currency-specific AI optimizations by enhancing the existing  and related components, starting step by step.
