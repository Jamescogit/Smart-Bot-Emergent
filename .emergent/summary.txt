The AI engineer successfully transformed a general trading bot into a specialized, scalping-focused application with enhanced UI and persistent learning. Initially, the project involved setting up a full-stack environment (React, FastAPI, MongoDB) and integrating diverse ML models. Key progress includes fixing critical backend serialization errors and overhauling frontend UI elements. The bot's core logic was heavily optimized for scalping strategies, including granular pip calculation, refined technical indicators, and intelligent trade labeling. The dashboard was streamlined for essential scalping metrics, removing clutter like candlestick charts. The latest effort involves implementing comprehensive data persistence to ensure the bot retains its learning across sessions.

The user sought a sophisticated, autonomous trading bot. Initially, it required integration of ML models (XGBoost, CatBoost, Prophet, TPOT) for price prediction, sentiment, and pattern discovery, utilizing EODHD, NewsAPI, and manual tweet data. Real-time updates and a dashboard visualizing market data, indicators, predictions, risk, and performance were crucial, alongside trade history and model persistence.

Recent explicit requests significantly refined the bot:
- **Candle Charts**: Initially requested with 30-second refresh for visual clarity, replacing a previous unclear chart.
- **Scalping Focus**: All bot logic, indicators, ML training, and trade evaluation to be optimized for fast timeframes (1-minute, 30-seconds) and scalping strategies (e.g., RSI reversal, breakout, MACD quick flip, tweet-based surges).
- **Real-time ML Training Visualization**: Displaying live progress, including win/loss rates and pips from mock trades.
- **Enhanced Trade History**: A detailed table with 17 specific columns (e.g., Time, Symbol, Action, Entry/Exit Price, Pips, % P/L, Confidence, Decision Factors, Trade Type, Forecast Trend, News Sentiment, Tweet Bias, Bot Strategy, ML Decision, Risk Level, Exit Reason).
- **Dashboard Cleanup**: Remove candlestick chart, remove Total Pips, and display only essential scalping metrics: Total Trades, Win Rate, Total Profit ($), Max Drawdown, Bot Confidence, Current Streak, Last Trade Result.
- **Persistent Learning**: The bot must automatically save and load its state (RL agent memory, trained models, feature history, trade logs) across sessions for continuous learning.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was implementing persistent learning for the trading bot. The user explicitly requested that the bot remember everything it has learned across sessions, including the RL agent's memory, trained ML models (XGBoost, CatBoost, Prophet), feature history, and trade logs. This data should be automatically saved to disk and loaded when the dashboard reopens, ensuring continuous learning without manual intervention.

The work currently involves:
1.  **Adding Persistent Learning Functions**: New  and  functions have been added to . These functions handle the serialization and deserialization of the bot's critical learning components (RL agent, ML models, etc.) using  to and from files on disk.
2.  **Auto-Loading Saved Data at Initialization**: The backend's initialization logic in  is being updated to automatically call the  function when the server starts. This ensures that any previously saved learning progress is restored immediately.
3.  **Adding Periodic Saving Background Task**: The plan includes setting up a background task to periodically save the bot's state, though the specific implementation of this background task (e.g., using  or a similar library) is not fully detailed in the provided trajectory.
4.  **Adding Save Triggers After Important Actions**: Save triggers are being integrated into critical sections of the backend code. Specifically, a save trigger has been added to the RL agent's  method in  to persist the updated agent state after it undergoes training or learning steps. The last observed action was adding this save trigger to the 's  method.

<optional_next_step>
Complete adding save triggers to all relevant sections (e.g., model training, trade logging) in the  for comprehensive persistence.
